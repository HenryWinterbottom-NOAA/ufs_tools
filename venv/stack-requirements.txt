# Description
# -----------

#    This file contains the Python packages required by the Python
#    virtual environment for selected ufs_tools applications.

# Building Instructions
# ---------------------

#    The Python virtual environment should be built as follows.

#    user@host:$ /path/to/python -m venv /path/to/virtual_environment

#    user@host:$ cd /path/to/virtual_environment

#    user@host:$ ./bin/pip install -r ../stack_requirements.txt

# Activation Instructions
# -----------------------

#    In order to activate the respective Python virtual environment,
#    do as follows.

#    user@host:$ . ./bin/activate

#    The action above assumes a POSIX bash environment (for additional
#    activation methods for different shells see
#    https://tinyurl.com/activate-venv); the successful result of the
#    above action will enter the user into the established virtual
#    environment.

#    To exit the Python virtual environment do as follows.

#    user@host:$ deactivate

# History
# -------

#    2023-01-29: Henry R. Winterbottom -- Initial implementation.

# Notes
# -----

#    - The Basemap and the basemap-data-hires packages are installed
#      via the Python stack conda application due to conflicts; this
#      will be resolved in the future with the implementation/upgrade
#      to cartopy.
